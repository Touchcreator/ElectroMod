# ElectroMod

A custom Discord client made with paperclips, bandaids, hopes, and dreams.

Due to the way I made it it's easily modifyable to your wishes. The source code is stored in the `(C:)/ElectroMod/` folder.

## Features
Currently the only feature availiable is custom themes, because I rushed this client. What should I add?

## Install
For Windows I have created an install and uninstall script. For other operating systems, you may have to install it manually.
